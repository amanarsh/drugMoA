This project delves into the use of autoencoders on the Mechanisms of Action (MoA) prediction dataset from Kaggle. This involve the use of autoencoders to gauge their ability in capturing, compressing, and reconstructing high-dimensional biological data to predict drug mechanisms. 

The project involved utilizing combined datasets of both gene expression and cell viability data as well as utilizing each respective dataset individually to gauge accuracy, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction in an MoA context.

Methods involved data preprocessing with relevant scaling and encoding along with formation of the main autoencoder architectures for both whole and segregated datasets.

Results showed that using the whole dataset outperformed segregated feature autoencoders, demonstrating a higher ability to capture more complex patterns. Overall, autoencoders show significant potential for MoA prediction, especially when combining both cell and gene data.
